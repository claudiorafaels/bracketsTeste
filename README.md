# Offline Contacts App with Meteor & Cordova
Meteor offline app example, with syncing and data persistence

The aim of this repo is to provide and example of an app that runs online as well as offline. In this example, any changes made when offline persist even if the app shuts down and the sync happens automatically when the app goes online.


Please note this is an experimental repo and I am more than willing to listen any kind of improvements that could be made.
